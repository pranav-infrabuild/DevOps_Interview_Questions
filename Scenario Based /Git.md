### Question 1. We have 50 commits in Develop branch and out of which only 5 commits needs to be pushed in Release branch (Which will eventually deployed in production} ?
<details>

To push only 5 specific commits from the Develop branch to the Release branch in Git, you can use the **`git cherry-pick`** command.  

1. **Cherry-Pick the Commits**: Use `git cherry-pick` to apply the selected commits from the Develop branch to the Release branch.
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-sha1> <commit-sha2> <commit-sha3> <commit-sha4> <commit-sha5>
   ```

In Linux, you can use the `useradd` command with the `-e` option to set an expiry date for a user account.

```bash
sudo chage -l kareem
